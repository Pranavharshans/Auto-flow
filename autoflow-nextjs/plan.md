# 🚀 Autoflow Development Plan

> **Comprehensive blueprint for building an AI-native agentic automation platform**

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

This plan outlines the theoretical foundation, architectural design, and phased implementation strategy for building Autoflow - an AI-native automation platform that bridges prompt-driven workflow generation with visual editing and transparent execution tracing.

**Core Innovation:** Transform static automation tools into intelligent, explainable agent systems where users can both prompt-generate and visually construct workflows while maintaining full visibility into AI decision-making processes.

---

## 🏗️ System Architecture Overview

### Architectural Principles

1. **Agent-First Design**: Every component operates as an intelligent agent rather than a static processor
2. **Transparency by Default**: All AI decisions, tool invocations, and data transformations are logged and traceable
3. **Dual Interface**: Support both prompt-driven generation and visual drag-and-drop construction
4. **Modular Composition**: Reusable, composable agent blocks that can be combined infinitely
5. **Human-in-the-Loop**: Critical decision points allow human oversight and intervention
