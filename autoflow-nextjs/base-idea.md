# Autoflow: An AI-Native Agentic Automation Platform

---

## 📌 Overview

Autoflow is a next-generation, AI-native automation platform designed for developers, operators, and non-technical users to build, execute, and manage agentic workflows. Built from the ground up on top of **Google ADK**, it combines the best of visual editors (like n8n) with the power of prompt-driven AI orchestration and transparent execution.

Users can:

* Drag-and-drop blocks to visually build flows
* Prompt Autoflow's LLM agent to generate workflows
* Inspect every execution in detail with trace logs
* Compose reusable agent components
* Deploy and self-host their own instance with full control
* Launch via one-click deployment solutions (Docker, Railway, Vercel, etc.)

---

## 🎯 Product Objectives

* Replace static, node-based automations (Zapier/n8n) with **agentic, explainable, prompt-native workflows**
* Enable **human-in-the-loop** debugging and development via UI + trace viewers
* Provide an **ownable**, fully transparent stack using Google ADK
* Balance simplicity for end users with programmability for developers
* Offer rapid onboarding and deployment through one-click solutions

## 🔧 Core Features

### 1. **Prompt-to-Automation (VibeCoding-Style)**

* Users describe what they want in plain English.
* The system plans a workflow using available components (agent blocks).
* Plan is previewed visually and as raw logic.
* Human-in-the-loop confirms, modifies, or regenerates.

### 2. **Drag-and-Drop Flow Builder**

* Canvas-based interface similar to n8n or Node-RED.
* Users can manually add/edit agent blocks and connections.
* Nodes = agent tasks with inputs, outputs, error fallback options.

### 3. **True Trace System**

* Every flow execution logs:

  * Agent reasoning steps
  * Tool invocations
  * Observations/responses
  * Errors and retries
* Traces are visual and textual (debug-friendly).

### 4. **Reusable Agent Components**

* Small modular task units ("blocks") that can be registered in the system
* Examples: Send Email, Query DB, Fetch API, Generate Summary
* Blocks include metadata (input schema, output schema, etc.)

### 5. **Two Modes of Build**

* **Manual Mode**: Drag & drop, no-code UX
* **AI Mode**: Prompt → Agent Plan → Executable Trace

### 6. **Execution Engine Powered by Google ADK**

* Each flow is converted into an ADK-compliant task sequence
* Supports retry logic, memory, external tools, and asynchronous ops
* Fully programmable and testable

### 7. **One-Click Deployment Options**

* Prebuilt Docker image for fast self-hosting
* Click-to-deploy templates (e.g., Railway, Render, Vercel edge functions)
* Optional GitHub Action template for CI/CD
* Hosted beta version for immediate exploration

## 🧪 Outcomes & Benefits

| User Type     | Benefit                                              |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Non-technical | Automate workflows via simple prompts + visual trace |
| Dev teams     | Build reusable automation logic, test agent chains   |
| Founders      | Build internal tools or automations fast             |
| Ops teams     | Remove repetitive tasks with explainable agents      |

## 🧠 What Makes Autoflow Different

* ✅ Prompt-first, agent-native logic (not JSON patching)
* ✅ Visual editing with full trace of agent behavior
* ✅ 100% ownable stack (Google ADK, not SUL-licensed)
* ✅ Built for transparency — no black box execution
* ✅ Designed for extensibility via custom agent blocks
* ✅ Deployable in minutes via one-click setup

## 🧑‍💻 Deployment & Hosting Instructions

### 1. **Requirements**

* Node.js (v18+)
* Docker (optional but recommended)
* Access to OpenAI, Gemini, or similar LLM APIs
* Redis or Postgres (for persistence layer)

### 2. **Repository Setup**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/autoflow-ai/autoflow.git
cd autoflow
npm install
```

### 3. **Environment Configuration**

Create a `.env` file:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=...
REDIS_URL=...
DATABASE_URL=...
ADK_PROJECT_ID=...
```

### 4. **Running the App**

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 5. **One-Click Deploy (coming soon)**

* Deploy to Railway: \[link here]
* Deploy via Docker Compose: `docker-compose up`
* Deploy to Vercel (edge-ready for frontend only)
* GitHub CI/CD template available in `/ci`

### 6. **Building Custom Blocks**

Each block is a folder in `/blocks`:

```ts
// blocks/send-email/index.ts
export default {
  name: "send_email",
  description: "Send an email using SMTP",
  inputs: ["to", "subject", "body"],
  execute: async ({ to, subject, body }) => {
    // ...send email logic
  }
}
```

### 7. **Prompt → Plan → Execution Example**

Prompt:

> "Send a welcome email when a user signs up, then add them to Notion."

Autoflow will:

1. Recognize "send email" and "add to Notion" as blocks
2. Create a two-step agent plan
3. Display plan and visual flow
4. Let user approve/edit
5. Execute via ADK
6. Show trace

## 📬 Validation & Feedback

We are currently validating this idea with:

* Devs, founders, operators, AI builders
* Early access testers and automation-heavy teams

**Key Questions:**

* Would you use prompt-based automation if you could edit it visually?
* How important is seeing the trace and errors?
* What tools or workflows would you want to automate first?
